## Tiger Logging System – Points of Weakness

1. **Recursive Calls in `SetLogFiles`**
   - The method uses recursion to handle file name conflicts and midnight rollovers. If the system clock does not advance as expected, this could theoretically lead to a stack overflow.

2. **Thread Shutdown Handling**
   - On application exit, the code waits up to 5 seconds for log writer threads to finish. If threads are blocked or the queue is large, some logs may not be flushed or could be lost.

3. **Error Handling in Log Writing**
   - If both the main and emergency log files fail, the only fallback is the `OnDataLost` event. There is no further persistence mechanism (e.g., in-memory backup, retry logic, or alternate storage).

4. **Buffer Flushing Logic**
   - The batching logic in `ProcessLogQueue` is complex and may not always flush the buffer optimally, especially if the queue is empty but the buffer still contains entries.

5. **Potential for Log Loss**
   - If the application crashes abruptly (e.g., process kill), logs in the queue or buffer may not be written to disk.

6. **Directory Creation**
   - The code relies on `path.ToDirectory().Create();` (likely an extension method). If this fails, it may not be handled gracefully.

7. **No Log File Size Management**
   - Log rotation is based on date, not file size. Large log files could accumulate if the application is long-running.

8. **No Asynchronous File I/O**
   - All file writes are synchronous, which could block the background thread if disk I/O is slow.

9. **No Configuration for Log Paths**
   - Log file paths are hardcoded to a "Logs" subdirectory under the base directory. There’s no support for custom paths or configuration.
